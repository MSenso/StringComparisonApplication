# StringComparisonApplication
Application for finding elements that are contained in a first file with ASCII string but not in a second one and vice versa

To run this application, you should run cmd/terminal and run "java -jar path/to/StringComparisonApplication.jar path/to/inputFile1
path/to/inputFile2 path/to/outputFile1 path/to/outputFile2"

Also, please, notice that having spaces in a path may lead to problems with running the application so you should move files with ASCII strings
and output files to another directory.
